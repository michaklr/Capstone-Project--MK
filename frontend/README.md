### `About the app`

Helping Hands is an app that would like to support you in recognizing emotional stress or suffering. The app uses a symptom rating system developed by psychologists. The originally developed rating system was intended to support psychologists in recording a patient's psychological symptoms as quickly as possible in order to be able to make a valid, standardized diagnosis for further therapy. With the help of Helping Hands, you can now carry out this rating test yourself, identify a need for treatment if necessary, and find psychological psychotherapists in your area.
